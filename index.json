[{"categories":null,"contents":"The age-long faction brought on by the snow made its way into the band. Yesterday at practice, I overheard Martin and Jonny talking about optimal POW conditions at Mt. Baker, and I sensed a little tension, like maybe a classic snowboarder vs. skiers lovers spat is happening within the band. Why do these folly factions infiltrate our snow culture AND music? By the end of the day, I don’t think the guys even knew what they were arguing about. Because I hate seeing division between bandmates, especially the bass and drums, I needed to know for sure what I was dealing with here. I know I shouldn’t have… but I stole both of their journals. Let’s see what there is to glean.\nJonny’s Diary Martin WOULD ski… That straight edge Cracker Jacks lookin’ french fry pizza boy. I’m more cross than his skis when he tries to go down a blue. We lived together for so many years and I knew he had skeletons in his closet\u0026hellip; But if I had known those skeletons were skis?!? I’d have moved out a long time ago. UGH. He had the gall to say that our new song “Page Me” gives off a classic skiers vibe. Bisshhh whaaaat? It’s so clear that the song naturally fits the steez of a snowboarder carving pow. What is he going to say next, that Watermark Rings symbolizes the mind-body connection between a skier and their poles? The pretension…\nMartin’s Journal I pity the man. Honestly. How Jonny thinks Checker Bloom makes snowboarding music is beyond me. Ha! This man stumbles at interpreting the music in the same way he stumbles trying to get off the lifts. Take a chill pill Shawn White. I knew his drumming technique looked familiar. He flails his sticks the same way a snowboarder flails their arms when they bust their bums on the terrain park.\nAs I feared… The boys have reverted to personal attacks. I’ve taken a huge risk obtaining the band\u0026rsquo;s private journal entries, but I believe this conflict must be met head on. Little do they two know that I, Greg, cross country ski. I believe, for the sake of the band, that I’ll keep this fact, much like the backcountry hills I traverse, peaceful and quiet. I wonder if people will listen to Checker Bloom on the mountain? Maybe they’ll check out this little local playlist of Bellingham bands to enhance their Mt. Baker experience.\n","permalink":"https://www.checkerbloommusic.com/blog/rifts-in-snow/","tags":null,"title":"Rifts in the Snow"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Woah well hello there! Happy New Year to ya. If you’ve found your way here, welcome. You likely know this by now, but in case not, we’re Checker Bloom, a garage rock band from Bellingham and Skagit Valley. We’re new to the Washington music scene and are hustling away crafting our sound and dipping our toes into live shows. The lineup was solidified in October 2021, and we played our first show December 3rd at the Shakedown in Bellingham. Gotta say, it was pretty shmackin. We’ve got some fun plans for more, uh, “shmackin”, shows in 2022, and not to mention some music coming out. Read along to meet the band and hear what we’re scheming.\nDem Boyz n the Band Jonny, aka Granny Toots, is a carpenter who owns his own business Split Nail Construction. This man is a fine craftsman and can’t seem to get enough wood in his hands, so he picked up drum sticks for Checker Bloom. Jonny is a bundle of love and brings the highest of energies on the kit. I’m trying to get Jonny to wear shorter shorts on stage so everyone can see the badass (and possibly on-ass) tattoos that his fiancè Madelyn did for him at Scapegoat Tattoo Collective. Jonny has a pit boxer mix named Alfred, and it goes without saying he is the goodest of boys.\nOur lead guitarist, Greg Mikels, is a Bellinghamster who works in tech (or something like that idk all I know is this dude real smart), living with his wife Demi and two dogs, Fern (Newfoundland) and Luna (Havanese Shih Tzu). Aside from his obvious guitar talents, Greg has some cool hidden talents that I feel obligated to expose to the world on this super high-traffic blog. Greg records albums and builds amps from scratch, which I think is the coolest thing ever.\nMartin aka “Teach” is our bass player and talk about another smart dude in the band. Martin went to school for music and is now a teacher, cultivating the talent of our nation\u0026rsquo;s future Bachs, Sinatra’s, and Gaga’s. I wanted to crack a joke about being surprised that people let this man teach the youth of America, but I couldn’t do it with a straight face. Martin’s an A1 dude and has the best bass playing stank face west of the Cascades.\nI’m Bryan, the one typing all this nonsense. Did you make it this far in the blog? Bet you didn’t. If you can’t tell, I have Bojangles Biscuit dry sarcasm wrapped in good intent and southern love. I’m on vocals and play guitar for the band. I hold it down over in the York neighborhood. I stay busy, practicing Muay Thai, playing Dungeons and Dragons, writing music, and working for a small environmental non-profit, Friends of the Inyo, doing grassroots organizing for environmental issues.\nCheers To The Things to Come I said earlier that we’re dipping our toes into live shows but that is a bit of an understatement. We’ve got 3 shows set up for Winter and Spring this year, with more outside of Bellingham to come. Next up is a soon to be announced gig at the Shakedown where Checker Bloom is supporting Seattle band King Youngblood. Later in February we are supporting our good friends Fossil Fire at the Wild Buffalo with Vendovi. Lastly, for now, we are headlining Scweinhaus Biergarten on St. Patrick’s Day with to be announced guests.\nUpcoming Bellingham Shows   The Shakedown 2/12/2022\n  Wild Buffalo 2/24/2022 TICKETS HERE\n  Schweinhaus Biergarten 3/17/2022\n  I’ll leave you with this. We’re going to be recording music over the next three months and releasing a single or two late Spring. We’re doing it all ourselves full DIY style. If you’re reading this blog, we appreciate you. Any support we get for making our music is a blessing. We do this to share experiences with our community and create smiles. Come to a show, hang out with the band. Let’s fill our cup.\nThe Checker Bloom Boyz\n","permalink":"https://www.checkerbloommusic.com/blog/humble-beginnings/","tags":null,"title":"Humble Beginnings and Onward to 2022"}]
